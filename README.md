### Description

This repository contains the authors' final project for CSE 547 (Machine Learning for Big Data) at The University of Washington. The authors performed analysis on and built predictive models for the data published in the Kaggle competition *Two Sigma Connect: Rental Listing Inquiries*, which can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/two-sigma-connect-rental-listing-inquiries). 

The  *Two Sigma Connect: Rental Listing Inquiries* competition provides a dataset which contains information on apartment rental listings in New York City. The objective of the competition is to create a model which predicts the interest level of users in a specific listing. The dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/two-sigma-connect-rental-listing-inquiries/data).
